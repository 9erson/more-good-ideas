Excellent! Let me create a brief summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-004: Create restore API endpoints**. Here's what was implemented:

### API Endpoints Created

1. **POST /api/archive/topics/:id/restore**
   - Validates topic exists (returns 404 if not found)
   - Validates topic is archived (returns 400 if already active)
   - Sets `topic.isArchived = 0` and updates `updatedAt` timestamp
   - Cascades restore to all ideas in the topic (sets `isArchived = 0`)
   - Returns restored topic with idea count, tags, and timestamps

2. **POST /api/archive/ideas/:id/restore**
   - Validates idea exists (returns 404 if not found)
   - Validates idea is archived (returns 400 if already active)
   - Checks if parent topic is archived (returns 400 with topic info if so)
   - Sets `idea.isArchived = 0` and updates `updatedAt` timestamp
   - Returns restored idea with topic name, tags, and timestamps

### Error Handling
- 404 for non-existent items
- 400 for items that are not archived
- 400 for ideas with archived parent topics (includes topic info in response)
- 500 for database failures (with try-catch and logging)

### Testing
- Added 9 comprehensive tests covering all acceptance criteria
- All 35 unit tests pass (17 archive tests including 9 new)
- Verified typecheck and build succeed

### Files Changed
- `src/index.ts` - Added both restore endpoints
- `src/archive-api.test.ts` - Added 9 new tests with 100% coverage of scenarios

All acceptance criteria for US-004 have been met and verified through comprehensive testing.

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
