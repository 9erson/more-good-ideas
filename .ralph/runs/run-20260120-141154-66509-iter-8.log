Perfect! The story US-008 is now complete. Let me create a final summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

**US-008: Write tests for archive functionality** is now **COMPLETE** ✅

### What Was Verified
- The comprehensive test suite in `src/archive-api.test.ts` already covers all 12 acceptance criteria
- All 25 archive API tests pass successfully
- Tests were implemented incrementally alongside the API endpoints (TDD approach):
  - US-001: 8 tests for GET endpoints
  - US-004: 9 tests for restore endpoints  
  - US-006: 8 tests for permanent delete endpoints

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage
✅ All 12 acceptance criteria verified:
1. GET /api/archive/topics returns archived topics only
2. GET /api/archive/ideas returns archived ideas only
3. Restore topic endpoint sets isArchived = 0
4. Restore idea endpoint sets isArchived = 0
5. Restore idea with archived topic returns error
6. Restore topic also restores its ideas
7. Permanent delete topic removes from database
8. Permanent delete idea removes from database
9. Permanent delete topic cascades to ideas
10. Test suite covers all success and error cases (200, 400, 404, 500)
11. Tests verify archived items not returned (empty array case)
12. All tests pass (verified with `bun test`)

### Quality Gates Verified
- ✅ `bun test` - 43 unit tests pass (25 archive + 18 existing)
- ✅ `bun run typecheck` - No TypeScript errors

### Commits Made
1. `6b6632d` - test(archive): verify comprehensive archive API test suite
2. `874a707` - chore(ralph): update progress log for US-008 completion

### Files Committed
- `.ralph/activity.log` - Activity logging
- `.ralph/errors.log` - No new errors
- `.ralph/progress.md` - Updated with completion details
- `.ralph/runs/` - Run logs and summaries for iterations 1-8
- `.agents/tasks/prd-archive-page.json` - PRD file
- `bun.test.config.json` - Bun test configuration
- `e2e/` - E2E test files (with pre-existing Playwright config issues)

### Remaining Files (Not Part of This Story)
- `biome.json`, `bunfig.toml`, `flow.sh`, `playwright.config.ts` - Modified but unrelated to archive
- `.factory/`, `tmp/` - Untracked directories (browser profiles and temp files)

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
