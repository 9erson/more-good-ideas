Perfect! Now let me provide a summary of what was completed:

## Summary

I've successfully completed US-006: Create permanent delete API endpoints. Here's what was implemented:

### API Endpoints Created
1. **DELETE /api/archive/topics/:id/permanent-delete** - Permanently deletes archived topics
2. **DELETE /api/archive/ideas/:id/permanent-delete** - Permanently deletes archived ideas

### Key Features
- **Hard deletes**: Uses SQL DELETE to permanently remove rows from the database
- **Cascade deletes**: Database foreign key constraints automatically delete related data (ideas, tags, feedback)
- **Safety checks**: Only allows deletion of archived items (isArchived = 1), preventing accidental deletion of active content
- **Orphaned tag cleanup**: Automatically removes tags that are no longer referenced by any topic or idea
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Returns 404 for non-existent items, 400 for non-archived items, and 500 for database errors

### Testing
- Added 8 comprehensive tests covering all acceptance criteria
- All 43 unit tests pass (no regressions)
- Tests verify cascade behavior, orphaned tag cleanup, and error cases
- Verified that deleted items cannot be retrieved (404 on subsequent fetch)

### Quality Gates
- ✅ bun test (43 tests pass)
- ✅ bun run typecheck (no errors)
- ✅ bun run build (successful compilation)

### Security & Performance
- Input validation via params checking
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Minimal database queries (DELETE + cleanup)
- Efficient cascade deletes via database constraints
- No N+1 query problems

The implementation follows all existing code patterns in the project and is production-ready.
