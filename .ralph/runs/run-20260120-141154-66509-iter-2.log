Excellent! The story has been successfully completed. Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-002: Implement archive page layout and navigation**. Here's what was implemented:

### Files Changed
1. **src/lib/types.ts** - Added `ArchivedTopic`, `ArchivedIdea`, and `ArchiveItemType` types
2. **src/components/Archive.tsx** - Complete rewrite from stub to full-featured archive page

### Features Implemented

✅ **Layout & Navigation**
- Sidebar navigation matching the Dashboard component
- Header with "Archive" title and description "View and restore archived items"
- Responsive layout for mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1920px)

✅ **Search & Filter**
- Search bar for filtering by name and description (case-insensitive)
- Tag filter dropdown populated from archived items
- Type filter toggle with three options: All Items / Topics Only / Ideas Only

✅ **Archive Item Cards**
- Type badge (Topic in blue, Idea in green)
- Name and description
- Tags displayed as badge pills
- Archived date formatted as "Jan 20, 2026"
- Idea count for topics

✅ **States**
- **Loading state**: Skeleton cards with animated pulse effect
- **Empty state**: "No archived items" message
- **Empty filter state**: "No archived items match your filters"
- **Error state**: User-friendly error message with retry button

✅ **Performance Optimizations**
- Used `useMemo` for expensive computations (allTags, filteredItems)
- Parallel API calls using `Promise.all` for better performance
- Efficient filtering logic with proper dependency arrays

✅ **Verification**
- TypeScript typecheck: **PASS**
- Unit tests: **PASS** (26 tests pass)
- Browser verification: **PASS** (all features working correctly)
  - Page displays 6 items (3 topics + 3 ideas)
  - Search functionality works correctly
  - Filter dropdowns are functional
  - Responsive layout verified on all screen sizes
