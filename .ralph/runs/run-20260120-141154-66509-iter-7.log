Perfect! All tests pass. Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-007: Implement permanent delete with confirmation**. Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added Delete Button** - Added a "Permanently Delete" button (destructive style with Trash2 icon) to each archived item card in the Archive component
2. **Confirmation Modal** - Implemented a comprehensive confirmation modal that:
   - Shows item type, name, description, and tags
   - Displays warnings about permanent deletion
   - For topics: warns that all ideas within will also be deleted
   - Requires user to type the exact item name to confirm (safety measure)
   - Has Cancel and "Delete Forever" buttons (red danger style)
3. **API Integration** - Connected to existing DELETE endpoints:
   - `DELETE /api/archive/topics/:id/permanent-delete`
   - `DELETE /api/archive/ideas/:id/permanent-delete`
4. **Error Handling** - Displays error messages in the modal with retry option if API call fails
5. **Success Feedback** - Shows toast notification on successful deletion and removes item from archive list
6. **Loading States** - Displays "Deleting..." and disables buttons during API call

### All Acceptance Criteria Met:
✅ Add 'Permanently Delete' button (danger style) to each item card  
✅ Clicking delete shows confirmation modal with warning message  
✅ Confirmation modal shows: item type, name, warning that this cannot be undone  
✅ For topics: show warning that all ideas in topic will also be deleted  
✅ User must type item name to confirm deletion (safety measure)  
✅ On confirm: call permanent delete API and update UI  
✅ Show success toast notification on successful deletion  
✅ Remove deleted item from archive list  
✅ Example: delete button shows modal, typing name and confirming removes item  
✅ Negative case: API error shows error message with retry option  
✅ Modal has 'Cancel' and 'Delete Forever' buttons (red danger style)

### Verification:
- **Unit Tests**: ✅ All 43 tests pass
- **TypeCheck**: ✅ Passes with no errors
- **Build**: ✅ Successful build
- **Security Audit**: ✅ Input validation, proper error handling, no sensitive data exposure
- **Performance Audit**: ✅ No N+1 queries, efficient state updates
- **Regression Audit**: ✅ All existing functionality unchanged

### Commit:
- **Hash**: `8b8f10b`
- **Message**: `feat(archive): implement permanent delete with confirmation modal`

The implementation follows the existing patterns from the restore functionality (US-005) and integrates seamlessly with the permanent delete API endpoints created in US-006.
