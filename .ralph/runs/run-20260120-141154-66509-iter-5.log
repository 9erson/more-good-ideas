Perfect! The story-related changes are committed. The remaining untracked and modified files are from other iterations or are configuration files. Let me create a final summary:

## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-005: Implement restore functionality with confirmation**. Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met

1. **Restore Button** - Added to each archived item card with a clear icon and label
2. **Confirmation Modal** - Shows comprehensive item details:
   - Item type badge (Topic/Idea with color coding)
   - Item name and description
   - Item tags as styled badges
   - Special message for topics showing idea count
3. **API Integration** - Calls restore endpoints and updates UI
4. **Success Toast** - Displays notification with item name after successful restore
5. **UI Update** - Removes restored item from archive list immediately
6. **Special Error Case** - Handles ideas with archived parent topics with specific error message
7. **Error Handling** - Shows error message in modal with retry option
8. **Modal Buttons** - Cancel and Restore buttons with proper styling

### 🎯 Verification Results

- **Unit Tests**: ✅ 35 tests pass (including 17 archive tests)
- **TypeCheck**: ✅ No TypeScript errors
- **Build**: ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- **Browser Testing**: ✅ Verified all functionality:
  - Restore button clickable and opens modal
  - Modal displays correct item details
  - Confirmation removes item from list
  - Toast notification appears
  - Error handling works for edge cases

### 📦 Files Changed

1. `src/components/Archive.tsx` - Added restore button, modal, toast, and error handling
2. `src/components/ui/toast.tsx` - Created new toast notification component
3. `package.json` - Added @radix-ui/react-toast and @radix-ui/react-dialog
4. `bun.lock` - Updated with new dependencies
5. `.ralph/progress.md` - Updated with detailed progress log

### 🔐 Security & Performance

- ✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ No performance regressions
- ✅ Local state update prevents unnecessary API refetches
- ✅ Loading state prevents double-submission
- ✅ Proper error boundaries and user feedback

### 🎓 Key Learnings

- Toast components require ToastProvider and ToastViewport
- Dialog state management uses open/onOpenChange props
- Discriminated union types provide type safety
- Local state updates provide instant UX feedback
- Error messages checked for specific text to handle edge cases
- Radix UI components handle accessibility automatically

The implementation is complete, tested, and committed. All quality gates passed and browser verification confirmed full functionality.

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
