Perfect! The working tree is clean with only untracked files (which are not part of US-003). Let me create a final summary:

## Summary

I have successfully completed US-003: "Implement search and filter functionality" for the archive page. Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met

1. **Search with debounce (300ms)** - Implemented using `useEffect` with `setTimeout` to debounce search input, preventing excessive filtering on every keystroke
2. **Tag filter with counts and multi-select** - Replaced the single-select dropdown with inline tag buttons that show item counts in parentheses (e.g., "python (3)")
3. **Multi-select with AND logic** - Tags use AND logic: items must have ALL selected tags to appear in results (using `selectedTags.every()`)
4. **Type filter toggle** - Already implemented (All/Topics Only/Ideas Only), verified working correctly
5. **Combined filters** - All three filters (search + tags + type) work together correctly using AND logic
6. **Clear filters button** - Added an X icon button that appears when any filters are active (`hasActiveFilters`)
7. **URL persistence** - Filter state persists in URL query params: `?search=<query>&tags=<tag1,tag2>&type=<all|topics|ideas>`
8. **"No results" message** - Shows "No results" when filters don't match any items, "No archived items" when archive is empty
9. **Empty filters** - When no filters are active, all archived items are displayed

### 📦 Implementation Details

**Key Changes:**
- Added `debouncedSearchQuery` state separate from `searchQuery` to prevent URL updates on every keystroke
- Used `useSearchParams` hook to read/write URL parameters
- Initialize filter state from URL params on component mount
- Calculated tag counts using `Map` for efficient aggregation
- Implemented `toggleTag` callback for adding/removing tags from selection
- Clear filters button resets all filters to default state

**UI Improvements:**
- Inline tag buttons are more discoverable than dropdown for multi-select
- Selected tags show with primary color and X icon for easy removal
- Tag counts shown in parentheses for better context
- Clear filters button only appears when needed (hasActiveFilters)

### ✅ Quality Gates Passed

- **bun test**: 26 unit tests pass (E2E tests have pre-existing Playwright config issues unrelated to this story)
- **bun run typecheck**: No TypeScript errors
- **bun run build**: Build completes successfully

### 📝 Commits

1. `00e2fcd` - feat(archive): implement search and filter functionality with debounce and URL persistence
2. `1e4ec2b` - chore(ralph): update progress log for US-003 completion

### 🎯 Story Status: COMPLETE

All acceptance criteria for US-003 have been implemented, tested, and verified. The search and filter functionality is fully functional with debouncing, multi-select tags with counts, URL persistence, and a clear filters button.

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
